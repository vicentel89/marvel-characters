```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```

## Architecture

The project is built using [Next.js with the app router](https://nextjs.org/). It uses [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules) for styling and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for processing the styles.

## Testing

As server components are new to the React ecosystem, some tools do not fully support them. So we use End-to-End Testing as [recommended by the Next.js team](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing#async-server-components).
